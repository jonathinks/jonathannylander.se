title: Jonathan Nylander - Notes
description: A space where I share notes about what I am learning, thinking and working on. These can be sketches, ideas or resources that I find useful, and hope others can find helpful in their learning journeys. The notes are never finished, but rather continously updated as I learn and grow myself.
