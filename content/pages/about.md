            <h2 style="font-style: normal; margin-top: 1.0rem;">Systems thinker and aspiring designer for the public good with an interest in informal learning, climate justice and technology.</h2>            
            <p>I enjoy being all over the place. Whevever I end up, I always carry with me a sense of curiosity and a backpack of perspectives, such as <a href="/developmental-psychology/">developmental psychology</a>, East-West cultural differences, systems thinking and <a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism/" target="_blank">metamodernism</a>.</p>
            <p>
            Lately I often end up thinking about politics and the complexity we have to deal with in making better decisions as a society. As a result, I have trained in various schools of systems thinking to help myself and others to play in this complexity.
