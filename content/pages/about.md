            <h2 style="font-style: normal; margin-top: 1.0rem;">Systems thinker and aspiring designer for the public good with an interest in informal learning, climate justice and technology.</h2>            
            <p>
            I enjoy being all over the place. Whevever I end up, I always carry with me a sense of curiosity and a backpack of perspectives, such as systems thinking, <a href="/developmental-psychology/">developmental psychology</a>, <a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism/" target="_blank">metamodernism</a> and various cultural perspectives.</p>
            <p>
            As of late, I often end up thinking about politics and the complexity we have to deal with in making better decisions as a society. I have therefore studied various schools of systems thinking to support myself and others to respond to the grand challenges of our time.
