# The Resource of Personal Data

The corporations with access to personal data can direct people's attention, even affect what actions taken, without the target being aware of it happening. Over time, this capability will grow stronger leaving us vulnarable to whoever have access to our personal data and sufficient computational power to predict our response for different triggers. This is one of the lessons I draw from Shoshana Zuboff's book on surveillance capitalism, and have seen in works of fiction such as Westworld. Most of us are used to give away our personal data in exchange of free services on the Internet, which could have some unintended consequences that we are not aware of.

When seen in this light, it's not a pretty picture of the future. All this data about us, both online activity but increasingly offline activity, is simply powerful. But rather than someone else using our data as a means to their ends, what if we had access to all the data we generate from inteacting with various services and devices? How could that benefit us, even improve our lives?
