During my time studying Sustainable Development at Uppsala University, I attended a course named Global Challenges and Sustainable Futures. As one assignment in the course, we had to create a new sustainable habit for 30 days and present it in a creative way (academic style writing was forbidden). My experiment was to not consume anything that contained plastic for 30 days.

The course Global Challenges and Sustainable Futures is taking place at <a href="http://www.web.cemus.se/" target="_blank_">CEMUS</a>, an institution at Uppsala University that was founded by students and to this day is mostly run by students. Students at the University will suggest topics for courses, students run courses and for most of the course invite guest lecturers from all kinds of context. It's a very unique place in higher education, and I highly recommend to check it out if you are interested in innovation within higher education.
