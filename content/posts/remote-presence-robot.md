In the process of starting Moonshot Academy, we experimented with different approaches to project-based learning. As my friend and co-facilitator Jaguar as going back to Alaska for a month, we decided to build a remote presence robot together with three teenagers, of which two were admitted students waiting for Moonshot Academy to open.

We worked alongside the students, shared tasks together and working as a team rather than a course or similar setting. As we discussed problems we encountered, it became small mini-lessons with the previous experience we as facilitators had in engineering and programming.
